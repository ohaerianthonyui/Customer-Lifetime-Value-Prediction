# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction


Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is a critical business metric that estimates the total revenue a company can expect to earn from a customer over the entire duration of their relationship. Rather than focusing solely on short-term transactions, CLTV emphasizes long-term profitability and customer retention.

In today's data-driven landscape, understanding CLTV allows businesses to make more informed decisions about marketing budgets, customer segmentation, and overall customer relationship strategies. High CLTV customers can be targeted with loyalty and upsell initiatives, while low CLTV segments might benefit from cost-efficient retention strategies or be deprioritized in resource allocation.

In this project, we aim to predict the CLTV of customers using historical transactional data. By analyzing features such as purchase frequency, monetary value, and recency of purchases, we train a machine learning model to estimate future customer value. This prediction enables more personalized marketing efforts, efficient resource allocation, and ultimately, improved profitability.
